# Enabling ISP-less Low-Power Computer Vision WACV2023

Our experiments are based on the [mmfewshot](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmfewshot) framework, plesase follow its instruction to install mmfewshot and mmdetection.

Our released dataset can be download from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gNG-GVd5gb-PO8U4hDkO_EL138S7e3MO/view?usp=sharing). It consists of 123287 npy files with a total size of 391 GB.

To integrate our dataset with mmfewshot, you should use our functions to load the dataset.

Our configurations for base training and few-shot learning by using Faster RCNN model are provided.
